MaterialUI is a UI kit for Unity that follows Google's official Material Design guidelines.

Please note that this package is outdated and is no longer worked on nor supported. You can find the [shiny new version of MaterialUI on the Unity Asset Store](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/51870), which is better, faster, and more feature-packed!

I'd advise only using this for learning purposes, as it probably won't work well with recent Unity versions.

You can contact me at materialUI@invexgames.com, but providing support for this package isn't my top priority.
